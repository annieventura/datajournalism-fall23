Futuristic crime detection program in FL town

### Clarity and accuracy

From the actual headline, "Targeted," I wasn't necessarily able to know exactly what the story was going to be about, but prior to the headline there were a few lines that succinctly described the main point of the story. I rate it a 5 because it was outlined within the first few lines.
* The main point of the story was that a new program created under the Pasco County Sheriff's office was supposed to be able to detect crime before it happened. In reality, the system profiled people that it considered likely of breaking the law and had deputies sent out to interrogate those people, even if there was no probable cause or search warrant. Within the first five years, the program had trapped 1,000 people, with at least 1 in 10 being younger than 18.
