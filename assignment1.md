## [Targeted](https://projects.tampabay.com/projects/2020/investigations/police-pasco-sheriff-targeted/intelligence-led-policing/)
Futuristic crime detection program in FL town

### Clarity and accuracy

From the actual headline, "Targeted," I wasn't necessarily able to know exactly what the story was going to be about, but prior to the headline there were a few lines that succinctly described the main point of the story. I rate it a 5 because it was outlined within the first few lines.
* The main point of the story was that a new program created under the Pasco County Sheriff's office was supposed to be able to detect crime before it happened. In reality, the system profiled people that it considered likely of breaking the law and had deputies sent out to interrogate those people, even if there was no probable cause or search warrant. Within the first five years, the program had trapped 1,000 people, with at least 1 in 10 being younger than 18.

There was no data visualization element in the article; all of the data was written. 
* Writing the data rather than consolidating it into some sort of graph was effective to some extent, I think. The impact was already large just based on the numbers themselves, but putting it in some sort of line graph could have been even more effective. For example, similar to the line graph we looked at during the first class, it might have been interesting to make the x-axis the ages of the targeted people and the y-axis could be the number of times people were contacted. Shortening the time or making it between a certain time period within the full extent of the program could make the graph even more effective.
* Another interesting visualization could have been to make a graph showing past nonviolent vs. violent criminal convictions of targeted people and the amount of times they were contacted by deputies.
* I would also be interested in seeing-- and not necessarily in the form of a graph-- numbers showing arrests after this program started that weren't of targeted people on the list. The article briefly mentioned that "the deputies didn't only go looking for the targets themselves" and used the example of a young woman that they harassed, whose boyfriend was a targeted person.

Generally, I think the data is accurate. I rate it a 4 for a couple reasons.
* The first reason I rate the accuracy a 4 is because at the end, the reporters say that some records had full pages redacted from the daily intelligence summaries. The unredacted parts outlined deputies following and quesitoning targets, so it makes me wonder if the redacted portions included other data that could have been included.
* The reporters also noted that the department refused to release the entire database and declined to provide certain details so it was difficult to say how many targeted people were minors. To mitigate this, the reporters made their own database matching names to every booking in Pasco jails. Juveniles' arrest records are public whenever they're charged with a felony, and based on those records, the reporters were able to find about 100 targeted people who may have been minors.

### Quality

The quality of this piece was really well done. I would rank it a 4 because, although there are no data visualizations, I think that having the data written was actually best for this piece. Regardless of the form, the reporters did a really great job of compiling the data when it wasn't provided. They also spent a lot of money for some of the data including body camera footage, police reports, criminal history reports, etc. Because of the detail that went into compiling the data, I think it was very comprehensive. One improvement that isn't data-related is the wording and way the story was written. For example, it seemed like the reporters reliquished a small piece of objectivity sometimes because some of the wording was very pointed and damaging. While the data supported that, I do think that the reporters included more on experts' opinions that made the data even more incriminating. Again, while I do think that the data speaks for itself and it *is* incriminating, a small bit of objectivity may have been relinquised. I don't believe this speaks to the quality of the piece necessarily.

### Type and color

N/A

### Creativity

While there were no data visuals used to supplement the story, there were documents, videos and pictures included that I found to be effective. I would rate the creativity element a 5. For example, the reporters included actual video camera footage of how deputies were contacting families, and even included Pasco's intelligence policing manual. For the manual, it may have been more helpful to highlight certain pages / quotes rather than just include the entire manual.
