## Background / findings
Redistricting in Virginia led to off-year elections for seats in the State House and Senate last month, ultimately ending with Democrats taking complete control of the state legislature. Before this, Republicans [held](https://www.vpap.org/electionresults/20211102/house/) a 52-48 majority in the House while Democrats already controlled the Senate. After flipping the House, Democrats now [hold](https://www.vpap.org/electionresults/20231107/house/) a 51-49 majority, thwarting Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s plan for a Republican trifecta in the state legislature and ruining the Republican agenda.

Virginia’s off-year election was significant because it may be [predictive](https://www.politico.com/news/2023/10/07/virginia-legislative-elections-2024-00120467) of the 2024 presidential election, especially with the unofficial issues on the ballot– abortion, education and the economy. Both Democratic and Republican candidates running for seats in the House campaigned on either restricting or loosening access to abortions, which is a national issue.

Following Virginia’s November election, abortion [became](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/08/us/politics/election-results-democrats-abortion.html) an issue potentially fueling Democratic wins, and may be predictive for Democrats in the upcoming presidential election.

Seven of the 100 House districts were listed as [competitive](https://www.vpap.org/elections/house/vpap-index/): 22, 89, 57, 21, 82, 97 and 65. The counties were Prince William, Chesapeake/Suffolk, Henrico, Petersburg/Dinwiddie, Virginia Beach and Fredericksburg. 

During the [2021 House elections](https://www.vpap.org/electionresults/20211102/house/), the Republican candidate won in the following aforementioned competitive districts: 22, 82, 97 and 65. Democratic candidates won in districts 89, 57, and 21.

[After the 2023 House elections, 2021](https://www.vpap.org/electionresults/20231107/house/), the Republican candidate won in the following competitive districts: 22, 89, 57 and 82. Democratic candidates won in districts 21, 97 and 65. Democrats flipped districts 97 and 65, Virginia Beach and Fredericksburg, from the 2021 results.

District 65 and District 97 may have been the only competitive House districts that Democrats flipped, but there were many others that Democrats were able to flip this past November: 1, 3-9, 12, 14-20, 23-29, 54, 55, 58, 65, 78, 81, 84, 85, 88, 91, 96 and 97.

The [new House district lines](https://www.vpap.org/redistricting/plan/house-of-delegates/) that Virginia adopted in December 2021 were an attempt to eliminate previous racial or political gerrymandering. The new boundaries in both competitive districts [65](https://www.vpap.org/offices/house-of-delegates-65/redistricting/) and [97](https://www.vpap.org/offices/house-of-delegates-97/redistricting/) are much smaller than the previous lines. 

Michael Feggans was the Democratic candidate from district 97 and Joshua Cole was the Democratic candidate from district 65. Both candidates campaigned on education, the economy and defending abortion access. These issues, particularly abortion, may be predictive of how Democrats could win the 2024 presidential election.

While redistricting is probably part of the reason why Democrats were able to flip so many House seats, campaigning on those unofficial ballot issues may have also been significant. The unofficial issues, especially abortion, may be meaningful predictors for how Democrats could win the 2024 presidential election and what candidates will probably campaign on. Additionally, looking at the issues in the competitive House districts that Democrats flipped and how candidates campaigned on these issues may also be predictive for the election next year.

### PROPOSED NUT GRAF
Democrats flipped the House of Delegates and won numerous seats that were previously Republican-controlled, including a couple districts that new district lines made competitive. Several issues claimed an unofficial spot on the ballot, including abortion access, which is a national issue that may be predictive of what voters will see in the upcoming 2024 presidential elections and how candidates, especially Democrats, plan to campaign on the issue.
## Plans for story format
### Reporting
#### Possible sources / interviews
* District 97 Democratic candidate Michael Feggans
* District 65 Democratic candidate Joshua Cole
We would ask these candidates how much they thought the new district lines impacted their district’s party flip from 2021 to 2023. We would also ask them about the issues they campaigned on, how they campaigned on them, why they chose to campaign that way and which issues they thought were most significant for voters.
* Candidates from districts flipped from Democrat to Republican
We would ask the candidates from these districts about the issues they campaigned on, how they campaigned on them, why they chose to campaign that way and which issues they thought were most significant for voters.
* Candidates from districts flipped from Republican to Democrat
We would ask the candidates from these districts about the issues they campaigned on, how they campaigned on them, why they chose to campaign that way and which issues they thought were most significant for voters.
* Nonpartisan political analysts
After comparing the way that Republican and Democratic candidates campaigned on different issues, we would ask political analysts why certain ways of campaigning on different issues, likely abortion, may have been more significant for Republicans versus Democrats, or vice versa. We would also ask if/how certain issues may be predictive of the 2024 presidential election.
* Experts
Brian Cannon, helped with the 2021 redistricting
We would ask about the process of redistricting, what went into the decision making for new district lines, the significance of redistricting and how it impacts voting (positive and negative).

Samuel Wang, director of Electoral Innovation Lab at Princeton University, [helped with gerrymandering project](https://gerrymander.princeton.edu/)
We would ask how the new district lines eliminate previous racial and political gerrymandering, what goes into the process of eradicating nonrepresentative Democratic/Republican lean in redistricting and details on the Princeton gerrymandering grading system.

Sean Trende, one of the Virginia redistricting mapmakers; Bernard Grofman, one of the Virginia redistricting mapmakers
We would ask what the process of redistricting looked like, where they started and how they removed any kind of partisan lean or subjectivity as they were creating the maps.
* Voters, especially competitive districts
We would ask voters what issues mattered most to them, especially in the swing districts, and what forms of campaigning were the most effective. We would also ask how they felt about the new district lines, especially in the more competitive districts, and if they felt the new boundaries accurately represent the district’s population. We would also talk to them about what issue(s) from this election they think they’ll be considering as the 2024 election approaches.
## Potential story structure
Lede with Democrats taking control of Virginia state legislature, flipping the House
PROPOSED NUT GRAF: Democrats flipped the House of Delegates and won numerous seats that were previously Republican-controlled, including District 97 and District 65, two districts that became competitive after redistricting. Several issues claimed an unofficial spot on the ballot, including abortion access, which is a national issue that may be predictive of what voters will see in the upcoming 2024 presidential elections and how candidates, especially Democrats, plan to campaign on the issue.

## Data analysis process
Redistricting in Virginia created new swing districts, but since this past November election was the first election using the new district lines, we knew that there wouldn’t be a ton of detailed reports and visualizations comparing the last House of Delegates election in 2021 to the one this year. 

We started by looking at the [Virginia Public Access Project](https://www.vpap.org/) and [Ballotpedia](https://ballotpedia.org/Virginia) to see the results for the 2023 election. We confirmed the results with the [Virginia Department of Elections](https://www.elections.virginia.gov/). 

For the 2021 results, we looked on Ballotpedia and VPAP, with final number confirmation being from VPAP.

Finally, to make the story more readable, we wanted to add two pie charts showing the final 2021 results versus the final 2023 results. For this data, we used the same VPAP links. 

We had to manually put the data from VPAP into an Excel spreadsheet. From there, we put the data into datawrapper.

* Map of competitive districts that flipped to Democrat
* Visualization (map) comparing Democratic-flipped competitive Districts 65 and 97 from 2021 versus 2023
